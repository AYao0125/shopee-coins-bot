Checkin to Shopee and get coins by CLI ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€

> **Warning**
>
> This bot is only tested for customers in Taiwan who use [shopee.tw](https://shopee.tw/).

The bot tries to login to user's Shopee account in the following order.

1. saved cookies if exist or given
2. username and password if both given

If argument `--cookie` is set, the bot tries to login with cookies. Cookies are then updated every time a login completes.

> **Warning**
>
> Cookies are confidential credentials. Do not share them with others.

## Usage

Login with username and password for the first time and save cookies for future use.

```sh
docker run -it -v /path/to/somewhere:/cookie \
    hyperbola/shopee-coins-bot:v1 -u username -p password -c /cookie
```

> **Warning**
